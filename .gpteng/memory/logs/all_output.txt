================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================ Human Message =================================

Request: システム自動作成のテストシステム自動作成のテスト

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the request, I will create a Python-based test system for automatic system creation. Here is the implementation:

**Folder Structure**
```
test_system_autogen
requirements.txt
src
__init__.py
system_creator.py
test_system.py
test
__init__.py
test_system_creator.py
```

**requirements.txt**
```
pytest
dataclasses
```

**src/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**src/system_creator.py**
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SystemConfig:
    """Represents a system configuration"""
    name: str
    description: str
    components: list

class SystemCreator:
    """Creates a system based on a configuration"""
    def __init__(self, config: SystemConfig):
        self.config = config

    def create_system(self):
        """Creates a system based on the configuration"""
        # Create system components
        components = [component() for component in self.config.components]
        # Initialize system
        system = System(self.config.name, self.config.description, components)
        return system

class System:
    """Represents a system"""
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, components: list):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.components = components
```

**src/test_system.py**
```
from .system_creator import SystemCreator, SystemConfig

def create_test_system() -> System:
    """Creates a test system"""
    config = SystemConfig(
        name="Test System",
        description="A test system",
        components=[ComponentA, ComponentB]
    )
    creator = SystemCreator(config)
    return creator.create_system()

class ComponentA:
    """A test component"""
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class ComponentB:
    """Another test component"""
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

**test/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**test/test_system_creator.py**
```
import pytest
from src.test_system import create_test_system

def test_system_creation():
    """Tests system creation"""
    system = create_test_system()
    assert system.name == "Test System"
    assert system.description == "A test system"
    assert len(system.components) == 2

def test_component_a():
    """Tests ComponentA"""
    component = ComponentA()
    assert isinstance(component, ComponentA)

def test_component_b():
    """Tests ComponentB"""
    component = ComponentB()
    assert isinstance(component, ComponentB)
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
